# Background
I worked on this project with Maggie Chen, Jessica Liu, and Evie Liu in Fall 2017. We researched a (seemingly) abandoned construction lot on the UC Berkeley campus and deployed a feature in the space.

We learned that the lot used to be the home to a student-run vegetable garden that raised awareness of food sustainability issues on campus. We wanted to design a feature that paid homage to the history of the lot by raising awareness of food issues students faced that fall. The issue at hand was the shrinking number of on-campus dining options that accepted meal points. 

We built a wooden sign that showed the distances and directions to all the restaurants on campus and placed it at the construction lot outside of Evans Hall. The signs specified whether the restaurants accepted meal points and showed which restaurants had closed down recently. 

I worked on documenting the site, designing/painting the signs, assembling the base, and observing interactions with the sign.

# Site Selection and Research
We were interested in "in-between" or "leftover" spaces on the UC Berkeley campus. We came up with a list of spaces we felt were forgotten or overlooked by most passerby and did some initial observations at each location. We found that some of our locations got significantly more traffic than we originally thought (the Strawberry Creek bridge and Bechtel rooftop terrace) and some were surprisingly quiet no matter what time of day we went. One of these quiet spaces was the lot in front of Evans Hall.

The lot was in a highly central part of campus, yet no one seemed to notice it or know why it existed.

We visited the site several times to document interactions taking place around the site and started digging online to learn about the history. We observed that the lot was either under construction itself or just a storage place for construction materials. We noted that cars would stay parked in the lot, even overnight. The areas surrounding the lot (Evans Hall, Memorial Glade) got a lot of foot traffic, but we never saw anyone stop at the lot - people would just walk around it. 

The space was...

* a construction staging lot for C. V. Starr East Asian Library (prior to 2009)
* a Victory Garden (~April 2009) that sought to raise awareness of campus food issues
* a storage area for the Moffitt library construction project and a parking lot (Fall 2017)

Why was the garden turned back into a construction staging lot? We tried contacting the team that originally worked on the garden project, but didn't get a response.

# Designing a Feature for the Space
We wanted to design a feature that would connect the lot to its roots of being a vegetable garden and space for on-campus food activism. We interviewed students to learn about food issues they currently faced. A few of the students we talked to told us how they felt like there weren't as many places to spend their meal points on campus anymore. They would skip meals or have to spend their own money at other campus dining options. We looked into this and saw that it was true - restaurants that accepted meal points were closing and the new dining options that were being built would not accept meal points. This was frustrating for a lot of students, especially those who were required to purchase meal points. The student population was steadily increasing, but the number of places students could actually spend their meal points on campus was shrinking.

We came up with the idea of building a sign that pointed to the different places you could eat on campus. The signs would signify which locations accepted meal points and would show the places that closed down.

	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/pl8.jpg" alt=""/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/pl9.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

We designed the signs in Adobe Illustrator and tested out different finishes of wax and paint after laser cutting them on sheets of plywood. We ended up painting the locations that accepted meal points white to provide contrast and used red paint to strike out the locations that had closed.

	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/pl12.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

We used 2"x3"x96" wood posts for our base and post. We used screws and wood glue to attach the signs to the post and build the base.

# Deploying the Sign
Our sign was placed at the intersection of our site and Memorial Glade on Tuesday, September 26th, 2017. We  observed the sign from Doe Library and Memorial Glade from 9:30-3PM that day. 

We saw people stop and take pictures. Many people circled around it to read all the text. But most people just walked on by. There was one interaction that stood out to me when I was observing the sign - two men with clipboards came by and started shaking the sign. They lifted it up, gave it a good shake, and placed it back on the ground about a foot from its original location. Maybe they were checking the structural integrity of our build!

You can see clips of some of the interactions in this short video I made:

When we returned to the location Wednesday morning to continue our observations, the sign was gone. It was stolen or confiscated - all that was left was a broken piece on the ground.
