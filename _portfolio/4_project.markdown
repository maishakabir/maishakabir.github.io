# Background
I worked on this project with Eric Yehl in Reimagining Mobility, a graduate level Design Innovation course with mentorship from Ford UX designers. We were interested in designing interactions and experiences inside cars of the future, so we conducted interviews, created personas, and synthesized our research into design imperatives. Our initial concept was something we called "the fifth room" - it was the idea of extending the functionality of rooms in houses to the space inside an autonomous vehicle. But more on that later.

# Research

We started our research by interviewing people who had long daily commutes. We wanted to learn what non-driving activities they engaged in and how they felt their time was being used. We hoped to use this information to project their desired experiences into a future of autonomous vehicles.

We talked to eight long distance commuters living and working in the Bay Area. Two of these interviews were contextual interviews - meaning we interviewed them as they drove along their daily route. Going along for the ride let us observe their behaviors as they drove and see how they interacted with things in their car. The rest of the interviews happened in person or over video calls.

After the interviews, we transcribed them and made interview summary charts for each person. We categorized the activities they did in the car (productivity, entertainment, mindfulness, or other) and pulled out quotes that highlighted their overall feeling about their commute.

Here's an example of one of our interview summaries:

After summarizing the interviews, we hit the whiteboards to map things out. We wanted to identify common threads between the interviews, and we wanted to group the roses/thorns/buds we identified.

We mapped out two personas, Sarah and Jim, from our interviews. Sarah and Jim are car commuters who have different goals when they're in the car. Sarah, a 23 year old UI designer, wants to relax, be entertained, and socialize when she's on the road. Jim, a 52 year old architect and dad, would prefer to connect with his family and get a head start on his work. Sarah doesn't mind her commute, while Jim strongly feels that it is wasted time. 

We saw this split in our interviews. Those who had longer commutes or more responsibilities at home, felt like the time really detracted from other areas of their lives. Those with shorter commutes (<1 hour) seemed to enjoy talking with the people they carpooled with or listening to new music and podcasts while on the road.

We used Sarah and Jim to create storyboards that showed some of the existing pain points surrounding their commutes.
