# Concept
This is Friend Crush &mdash; a phone case game that helps people form closer relationships. A friend crush is a platonic crush on a person you want to become friends with. Basically, you think this person is cool, and you want to get to know them better.

Two people who have “friend crushes” on each other are matched through a survey and receive phone cases that have missing puzzle pieces on the back. Each person has the pieces that fit into the other person’s phone case. The pieces have instructions for activities engraved on the back so after completing an activity, the participants can exchange the pieces. Every completed activity brings them closer to completing the design on the phone case and (hopefully) to each other! Once they finish exchanging pieces, they can keep the completed phone case or pass it on to a new set of people.

# Background

My team and I were interested in exploring platonic relationships in young adults. We wanted to learn about how college students make new friends, maintain old friendships, and define various levels of closeness. I worked on this project with three other designers and contributed mainly to the research and physical prototyping.

We interviewed six people and found that they broadly divided their relationships into three categories: acquaintances, friends, and close friends. We asked about what distinguished these categories and people responded:
* depth/breadth of conversation topics 
* level of comfort
* time spent together outside of required activities (i.e. work, class)

All of our interviewees talked about how the process of going from being acquaintances to friends is sometimes uncomfortable and filled with uncertainty. This finding brought us to our design objective: **helping two people who are acquaintances get closer.**

How might we turn a "friend crush" into a real friendship?

We came up with activities that would strengthen a relationship and tried to gamify the process of getting to know a person. We hypothesized that the phone case puzzle format would be effective because it would remind the users about the friendship every time they looked at their phone and motivate them to complete the activities (and complete the case!).

#### Activities and Instructions

Drawing inspiration from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html" target="blank">36 Questions That Lead to Love</a> and our interviews, we came up with activity prompts that would build familiarity and intimacy between the participants. We tried to keep our instructions short and open to interpretation.

Our interviewees mentioned it was awkward asking an acquaintance to hang out for the first time. Having a set of activities/instructions to follow would reduce some of the initial decision making and anxiety around what to do. 

Some of our instructions centered around doing activities together (2, 3, 6) and some around the conversation (1, 4, 5). We wanted the conversation to be "deep" and require some vulnerability or trust. The activities were there to help the participants spend time together outside of wherever they normally saw each other.

We hoped the participants would take more control of their friendship journey as they progressed through the instructions, so instructions 6 and 7 are the most open ended. Instruction 7 ("pass it on") is completely open to interpretation. Participants can pass on some object/story/idea to each other, or even pass the phone cases onto another pair to continue the cycle of friendship.

The instructions:
1. Ask for advice
2. Study together
3. New restaurant
4. Three things in common
5. Share life story
6. Choose your own activity
7. Pass it on

These instructions were later engraved on the backs of the puzzle pieces. 

#### Low Poly Design

</div>

We designed two cases with unique shapes so the users would have to meet with each other to complete their cases.

#### Prototyping
We laser cut the pieces out of 1/8" plywood and engraved the instructions. We created the laser cut files in Adobe Illustrator and tested out different sizes to get the perfect fit.

We initially tried hand painting the pieces in a gradient, but ended up making each piece a different color to get the low poly look.

For the phone case, we took a mesh file of a plain iPhone case and extruded the outlines of the puzzle pieces on the back. This was done in Fusion360. Our first print was too brittle, so we switched to soft PLA for the printing material. We tried out different methods to get the pieces to stay. We tested mechanisms like Lego pieces and slants, but found that straight extrusions of the outlines with pieces that were laser cut exactly to size worked best.

# Final Thoughts

Friendships naturally progress in unique ways, but we learned from our interviews that there are some constants in the way people define different levels of friendship. As you get closer to a person, you typically spend more time together outside of required activities, you start talking about "deeper" topics, and you feel more at ease around the other person. We designed our activities using these findings and other social psychology research, and we created phone cases that can help turn "friend crushes" into real friendships.

Some next steps for this project would be conducting usability testing with a wider audience and creating cases that fit different types of phones. We could also get more user feedback about our activities and test different progressions/combinations of activities.
