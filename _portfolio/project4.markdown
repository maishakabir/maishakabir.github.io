# Background
This is a project I worked on with Eric Yehl in Reimagining Mobility: Design Exploration and Research. The graduate level Design Innovation course asked us to look 10-15 years into the future of transportation and explore interactions between humans and different transportation modalities. My partner and I wanted to explore interactions and experiences inside of autonomous vehicles, so we started researching and defining the problem. We conducted interviews, created personas, and synthesized our research into design imperatives. We found that a self-driving future opens up the car as a space with endless possibility &mdash; the car has the potential to be a space of work, creativity, leisure, self-improvement, and so much more.

# Research

Who is the typical user of a self-driving car today? And who will the user be in 10-15 years? These are the questions we asked ourselves when we started thinking about autonomous vehicles. At the time of our inquiry, October 2017, it seemed like the majority of users were people who were directly involved in the development and testing of these cars. There were some users who were just passengers, but only in select urban areas that had limited deployments of autonomous vehicles (i.e. Lyft/nuTonomy in Boston in December 2017).

The early 2020s seemed to be the <a href="https://emerj.com/ai-adoption-timelines/self-driving-car-timeline-themselves-top-11-automakers/" target="blank">industry projected date</a> for a significant number of autonomous vehicles on the roads. While the timeline was not certain, we assumed that the number of autonomous vehicles on roads would continue to increase and become more affordable/accessible to the general public with time. In 10-15 years, self-driving cars would be deployed in more areas and serve a diverse group of passengers. 

#### Interviews

We decided to interview eight long distance commuters living in the Bay Area. These commuters did not use self-driving cars to get to work - but they did spend at least an hour of their day inside a car 5-7 days a week. We wanted to learn how they currently used that time and space. What non-driving activities did they engage in? How did they feel their time was being used? We hoped to use this information to project their desired experiences into a future of autonomous vehicles.

Most of our interviews took place in-person. Two of them were contextual interviews, meaning we interviewed them as they drove us along their daily route. Going along for the ride added another dimension to the interviews because we got to observe their behaviors as they drove and see their reactions to external factors (e.g. weather, traffic) that could play a role in the commuting experience. 

We summarized each interview afterwards by pulling out important quotes and categorizing the activities into sections (productivity, entertainment, mindfulness, and other). 

Here's an example of one of our interview summaries:

As we started synthesizing our interviews, we saw that the people we interviewed had differing attitudes and purposes re: their commutes. The activities they engaged in (and wanted to engage in) varied as well! We still found patterns across our interviews and used those to develop two personas.

#### Personas

We mapped out two personas, Sarah and Jim, from our interviews. Sarah and Jim are car commuters who have different goals when they're in the car. Sarah, a 23 year old UI designer, wants to relax, be entertained, and socialize when she's on the road. Jim, a 52 year old architect and dad, would prefer to connect with his family and get a head start on his work. Sarah doesn't mind her commute, while Jim strongly feels that it is wasted time. 

We saw this split in our interviews. Those who had longer commutes or more responsibilities at home, felt like the time really detracted from other areas of their lives. Those with shorter commutes (<1 hour) seemed to enjoy talking with the people they carpooled with or listening to new music and podcasts while on the road.

We used Sarah and Jim to create storyboards that showed some of the existing pain points surrounding their commutes.
