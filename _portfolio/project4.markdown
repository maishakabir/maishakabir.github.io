# Background
This is a project I worked on with Eric Yehl in Reimagining Mobility: Design Exploration and Research. The graduate level Design Innovation course asked us to look 10-15 years into the future of transportation and explore interactions between humans and different transportation modalities. My partner and I wanted to explore interactions and experiences inside of autonomous vehicles, so we started researching and defining the problem. We conducted interviews, created personas, and synthesized our research into design imperatives. We found that a self-driving future opens up the car as a space with endless possibility &mdash; the car has the potential to be a space of work, creativity, leisure, self-improvement, and more.

# Research

Who is the typical user of a self-driving car today? And who will the user be in 10-15 years? These are the questions we asked ourselves when we started thinking about autonomous vehicles. At the time of our inquiry, late 2017, it seemed like the majority of users were people who were directly involved in the development and testing of these cars. There were some users who were just passengers, but only in select urban areas that had limited deployments of autonomous vehicles (i.e. Lyft/nuTonomy in Boston in December 2017).

The early 2020s seemed to be the <a href="https://emerj.com/ai-adoption-timelines/self-driving-car-timeline-themselves-top-11-automakers/" target="blank">industry projected date</a> for a significant number of autonomous vehicles on the roads. While the timeline was not certain, we assumed that the number of autonomous vehicles on roads would continue to increase and become more affordable/accessible to the general public with time. In 10-15 years, self-driving cars would be deployed in more areas and serve a diverse group of passengers. 

#### Interviews

We decided to interview eight long distance commuters living in the Bay Area. These commuters did not use self-driving cars to get to work - but they did spend at least an hour of their day inside a car 5-7 days a week. We wanted to learn how they currently used that time and space. What non-driving activities did they engage in? How did they feel their time was being used? We hoped to use this information to project their desired experiences into a future of autonomous vehicles.

Most of our interviews took place in person. Two of them were contextual interviews, meaning we interviewed them as they drove us along their daily route. Going along for the ride added another dimension to the interviews because we got to observe their behaviors as they drove and see their reactions to external factors (e.g. weather, traffic) that could play a role in the commuting experience. 

We summarized each interview afterwards by pulling out important quotes and categorizing the activities they mentioned into sections (productivity, entertainment, mindfulness, and other). 

Here's an example of one of our interview summaries:

As we started synthesizing our interviews, we saw that the people we interviewed had differing attitudes and purposes regarding their commutes. The activities they engaged in (and wanted to engage in) varied as well! We still found patterns across our interviews and used those to develop two personas.

#### Personas &mdash; Meet Sarah and Jim

Sarah and Jim are car commuters who have different goals when they're in the car. Sarah, a 23 year old UI designer, wants to relax, be entertained, and socialize when she's on the road. Jim, a 52 year old architect and dad, would prefer to connect with his family and get a head start on his work. Sarah doesn't mind her commute, while Jim strongly feels that it is wasted time.

We used Sarah and Jim to storyboard different situations and get a deeper understanding of our users and their pain points.

# Design Imperatives

As we compiled insights from our interviews and personas, we started looking at them as design imperatives. These are the important things to consider when designing for autonomous vehiciles. 

1.	**Basic safety, comfort, and privacy first.**
	If these needs are not met, users do not feel good about engaging in other activities inside a car. Users need to trust that the autonomous vehicle is safe.
2.	**Design for multidimensional variety of activity.**
	Users want to do a variety of things in their cars. From working out, to catching up on work, to watching new episodes of their favorite TV show. 
3.	**Consider the social subtext of situations within cars.** 
	Users often have social motivations behind their use of vehicles. Cars also have unique social dynamics inside because of the way seats are arranged.  
4.	**Recognize passive and active approaches to creating experiences inside of autonomous vehicles.** 
	Designers can give users abilities by providing specific tools or by providing space and creative license.


# Ideation 
#### How Might We...?
We knew that users wanted to do a variety of activities while travelling in a car. The commuters we interviewed wanted to sleep, work, exercise, connect with family, and more.

*How might we facilitate these activities while providing safety and comfort?  
How might we address privacy and legal concerns?  
How might we design for social interaction?*

We kept these questions and the design imperatives in mind as we brainstormed.

One of our early ideas was a car sharing service where people could request autonomous vehicles perfectly tailored to their needs, e.g. office cars, sleep cars, movie theater cars, etc. We used bodystorming to explore interior designs for these need-specific cars.

#### The Fifth Room Concept
With autonomous vehicles, the constraint of having to drive or focus on the road is removed. This means users can utilize that time and space differently. We started to think about the space inside an autonomous vehicle as a space that can do more than just get a person to their destination. The journey and destination can blend.

This space could be like a room in a house that people adapt to their needs, only mobile&mdash;a fifth standard room. We drew inspiration for defining this space from the emotional and practical contexts of the kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom.
