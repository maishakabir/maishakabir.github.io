# Background
This is a project I worked on with Eric Yehl in Reimagining Mobility: Design Exploration and Research. The graduate level Design Innovation course asked us to look 10-15 years into the future of transportation and explore interactions between humans and different transportation modalities. My partner and I wanted to explore interactions and experiences inside of autonomous vehicles, so we started researching and defining the problem. We conducted interviews, created personas, and synthesized our research into design imperatives. We found that a self-driving future opens up the car as a space with endless possibility &mdash; the car has the potential to be a space of work, creativity, leisure, self-improvement, and more.

# Research

Who is the typical user of a self-driving car today? And who will the user be in 10-15 years? These are the questions we asked ourselves when we started thinking about autonomous vehicles. At the time of our inquiry, October 2017, it seemed like the majority of users were people who were directly involved in the development and testing of these cars. There were some users who were just passengers, but only in select urban areas that had limited deployments of autonomous vehicles (i.e. Lyft/nuTonomy in Boston in December 2017).

The early 2020s seemed to be the <a href="https://emerj.com/ai-adoption-timelines/self-driving-car-timeline-themselves-top-11-automakers/" target="blank">industry projected date</a> for a significant number of autonomous vehicles on the roads. While the timeline was not certain, we assumed that the number of autonomous vehicles on roads would continue to increase and become more affordable/accessible to the general public with time. In 10-15 years, self-driving cars would be deployed in more areas and serve a diverse group of passengers. 

#### Interviews

We decided to interview eight long distance commuters living in the Bay Area. These commuters did not use self-driving cars to get to work - but they did spend at least an hour of their day inside a car 5-7 days a week. We wanted to learn how they currently used that time and space. What non-driving activities did they engage in? How did they feel their time was being used? We hoped to use this information to project their desired experiences into a future of autonomous vehicles.

Most of our interviews took place in-person. Two of them were contextual interviews, meaning we interviewed them as they drove us along their daily route. Going along for the ride added another dimension to the interviews because we got to observe their behaviors as they drove and see their reactions to external factors (e.g. weather, traffic) that could play a role in the commuting experience. 

We summarized each interview afterwards by pulling out important quotes and categorizing the activities into sections (productivity, entertainment, mindfulness, and other). 

Here's an example of one of our interview summaries:

As we started synthesizing our interviews, we saw that the people we interviewed had differing attitudes and purposes re: their commutes. The activities they engaged in (and wanted to engage in) varied as well! We still found patterns across our interviews and used those to develop two personas.

#### Personas

We mapped out two personas, Sarah and Jim, from our interviews. Sarah and Jim are car commuters who have different goals when they're in the car. Sarah, a 23 year old UI designer, wants to relax, be entertained, and socialize when she's on the road. Jim, a 52 year old architect and dad, would prefer to connect with his family and get a head start on his work. Sarah doesn't mind her commute, while Jim strongly feels that it is wasted time. 

We saw this split in our interviews. Those who had longer commutes or more responsibilities at home, felt like the time really detracted from other areas of their lives. Those with relatively shorter commutes seemed to enjoy talking with the people they carpooled with or listening to new music and podcasts while on the road.

We used Sarah and Jim to storyboard different situations and get a deeper understanding of our users and their pain points.

# Design Imperatives

As we compiled insights from our interviews and personas, we started looking at them as design imperatives. These are the important things to consider when designing for autonomous vehiciles. 

1.	Basic safety, comfort, and privacy first.
	* If these needs are not met, users do not feel good about engaging in other activities inside a car. Users need to trust that the autonomous vehicle is safe.
2.	Design for multidimensional variety of activity. 
	* Users want to do a variety of things in their cars. From working out, to catching up on work, to watching new episodes of their favorite TV show. 
3.	Consider the social subtext of situations within cars.
	* Users often have social motivations behind their use of vehicles. Cars also have unique social dynamics inside of them.  
	* Some of our interviewees mentioned how they preferred having difficult conversations while driving. They felt like not having to make eye contact or face the person while talking made it easier for them to be vulnerable.
	* Would you sit in the back seat if your friend was driving and the front passenger seat was open? An interviewee talked about how a friend did this to them once and how it made them feel like a chauffer.  
4.	Recognize passive and active approaches to creating experiences inside of autonomous vehicles. 
	* Designers can give users abilities by providing specific tools or by providing space and creative license.


# Initial Concepts and Next Steps

Once we had these design imperatives, we started to brainstorm.

What will car ownership look like in the future? Will people view cars as something that is personal and something they own, or will they see it as something that simply provides impersonal utility. We had this idea of “the fifth room” – the car as an extension of rooms in a house.  

When the constraint of having to drive or focus on the road is removed, the car can be a space of much more. The journey and destination can overlap.

[need to edit text below]

* Continuing developing our ideas, looking at car sharing (what if you could order an autonomous car perfectly tailored to your needs? What would these need-specific cars look like on the inside?) 

* We began to think of the car of the future as a space that allows interaction within itself rather than an object that allows interaction with the network of origins, roadways, and destinations. Such a space would be much like a room in a house that people adapt to their needs, only mobile---a fifth standard room. We drew inspiration for defining this space from the emotional and practical contexts of the kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom.

* We imagine that this concept could develop into opposing models of ownership and use. On one side owners could feel more attachment to their vehicles than they already do,  while others could view these mobile spaces as purpose-oriented tools (like they view their office, a hotel room, or a movie theatre). 

* We came up with the idea of a car sharing service where people request vehicles for specific uses, e.g. party cars, office cars, sleep cars, and so on. We believe companies like Uber and Lyft will soon allow drivers to advertise their spaces as purpose-oriented, and that this is a natural step towards realization of the Fifth Room concept.
