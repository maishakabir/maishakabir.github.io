Hi, I’m Maisha! I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Cognitive Science and focus in Design Innovation. I’m interested in exploring how people interact with technology and designing experiences that are intuitive and joyful. Curiosity and research drive my design process.

I have work experience in application security engineering and leadership experience directing a nonprofit organization. My interdisciplinary background has set me up to approach problems from many different lenses and come up with creative solutions. 

Some of my other interests include increasing the accessibility of arts education in schools and empowering girls to pursue STEM fields. I also like to bake pies, read fantasy novels, and hike in the beautiful Pacific Northwest (when it’s not raining!).

I’m currently seeking UX opportunities and would love to chat about any projects. You can email me at mkabir@berkeley.edu or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maishakabir/" target="blank">LinkedIn</a>.
