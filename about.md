Hi, I'm Maisha! I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Cognitive Science. I'm passionate about community outreach - increasing the accessibility of arts education in schools and mentoring girls/encouraging them to pursue STEM fields.

In my free time I like to bake tarts, read Sci-Fi novels, and go hiking in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
